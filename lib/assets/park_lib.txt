An amusement park is always fun to visit on a hot summer 1. When you get there you can wear your 1 and go for a swim. And there are lots of 3 things to eat. You can start off with an 3 dog on a/an 1 with mustard, relish and 4 on it. Then you can have a buttered ear of 1 with a nice 3 slice of pizza and a big bottle of cold 1. When you are full, itâ€™s time to go on the roller coaster, which should 2 your stomach. Other amusement park rides are bumper cars, which have little 1 that you drive and 2 into other 4, and the merry go round where you can 2 on a big 1 and try and grab the gold 4.
