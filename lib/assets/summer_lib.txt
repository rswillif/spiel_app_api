Last summer my parents 2 me on a trip to 1. The weather there is very 3! It has many 4 and they make 3 4 there. Many people also go to 1 to 2 or see the 6. The people that live there love to VERB 4 and are very proud of their big 1. They also like to 2 in the sun and swim in the 1. It was a really 3 trip!
