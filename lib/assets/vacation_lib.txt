A vacation is when you take a trip to some 3 place
with your 3 family. Usually you go to some place
that is near a/an 1 or up on a/an 1.
A good vacation place is one where you can ride 4
or play 1 or go hunting for 4 . I like
to spend my time 2 or 2.
When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating
three 4 a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers
sit around 2. Last summer, my little brother
fell in a/an 1 and got poison 1 all
over his 4. My family is going to go to (the)
1, and I will practice 2. Parents
need vacations more than kids because parents are always very
3 and because they have to work 1
hours every day all year making enough 1 to pay
for the vacation.
